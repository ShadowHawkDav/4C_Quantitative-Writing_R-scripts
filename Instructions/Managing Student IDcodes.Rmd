## Student IDCodes are used to cleanse personally identifiable information from project data.

####Looking forward, one of the best ways to expand the scope of htis project is to share these analysis techniques with other educators to use in their classroom.

*The benefits of sharing these tools and techniques inclue:*

- Growing our database with the addition of student performance data from other instructors, disciplines, and schools
- Allow other instructors to ask their own questions about studnet learning using data from their classrooms.

*However, paramount to this process is the ability to remove personally identifiable information from project files before they are shared with other instructors.*

*Beacause of this, the student IDCode database will allow us to remove student names while still maintaing a link to original data sources to maintain data integrity.*



## Format structure of IDCode
- *The IDcode consists of six alphnumeric digits that help to identify key aspects of the course while also maintaining a random element to protect student identiy.*

- *The IDcode will also be used to serve as a unique identifier to link data stored in different data tables / data frames*

*- Finally, the IDcode has been designed to allow for other data sources besides student information should the need arise.*

IDCode Digit position | Meaning
------ | ------------------------------------------------
1 | Data source (A= Student, 2= publication)
2 | Course ID (A= Bio25, see Course ID table for more) 
3 | Course Year (A= 2015, B= 2016, C= 2017, etc)
4 - 6| *3 digit number number randomly assigned to students within a single class.*  

## Cleansing data sources - Part 1

The process of cleansing data sources consists of:

1. Split student names into first and last names and sort by random number
2. Generating new random IDCode for each student in a class
3. Copying IdCode to new data source and visually verify 
4. Deleting student names from data source

## Step 1 - Split student names into first and last name columns.

## Step 2 - Generate new random IDCodes for each student.

## Step 3 and 4 - Copy ID Codes back to data source, inspect, and delete extra columns.
