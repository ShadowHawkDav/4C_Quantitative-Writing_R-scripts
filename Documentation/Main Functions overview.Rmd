knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '..')
```

## Only some of the function for the project will be visible in the user environment when RStudio is started

*This reduces the number of objects that are visible to the user to reduce clutter.*
*The functions in this list will be ones that are key to starting or finishing an analysis (data import, df loading, df saving, etc)*

####The current list of functions that are available are:

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(Jmisc)
sourceAll("./R_Functions/mainFunctions")
#cat(list.files("./R_Functions/mainFunctions"),sep="\n")
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
